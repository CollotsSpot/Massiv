# Player Lifecycle Management Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-05
**Branch:** fix/rock-solid-player-lifecycle
**Based on:** [MA Player Lifecycle Research](/home/home-server/analyses/ma-player-lifecycle-research.md)

---

## Overview

This document describes Ensemble's production-ready player lifecycle management system. The implementation is based on extensive research of Music Assistant's official clients (KMP, Desktop Companion, Web Frontend) and is designed to prevent ghost player accumulation and ensure stable multi-client operation.

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Single Player Per Installation

**Pattern:** Matches KMP client implementation
**Storage:** `local_player_id` in SharedPreferences
**Format:** `ensemble_<uuid>`

Each app installation maintains a single, persistent player ID that survives app restarts and network disconnections.

```dart
// DeviceIdService - Single source of truth
const String _keyLocalPlayerId = 'local_player_id';

static Future<String> getOrCreateDevicePlayerId() async {
  final existingId = prefs.getString(_keyLocalPlayerId);
  if (existingId != null && existingId.startsWith('ensemble_')) {
    return existingId; // Reuse existing
  }

  // Generate once, store forever
  final playerId = 'ensemble_${uuid.v4()}';
  await prefs.setString(_keyLocalPlayerId, playerId);
  return playerId;
}
```

### 2. Smart Reconnection

**Problem:** Reconnecting always re-registered players, creating duplicates
**Solution:** Check if player exists before registration

```dart
// Check before registering
final existingPlayers = await _api!.getPlayers();
final existingPlayer = existingPlayers.where((p) => p.playerId == playerId).firstOrNull;

if (existingPlayer != null && existingPlayer.available) {
  // Already registered - just resume state updates
  _startReportingLocalPlayerState();
  return;
}

// Only register if needed
await _api!.registerBuiltinPlayer(playerId, name);
```

### 3. Registration Guard

**Problem:** Rapid connect/disconnect could trigger multiple simultaneous registrations
**Solution:** Guard with Completer to serialize registration attempts

```dart
Completer<void>? _registrationInProgress;

Future<void> _registerLocalPlayer() async {
  if (_registrationInProgress != null) {
    // Wait for existing registration to complete
    return _registrationInProgress!.future;
  }

  _registrationInProgress = Completer<void>();
  try {
    // ... registration logic ...
    _registrationInProgress?.complete();
  } catch (e) {
    _registrationInProgress?.completeError(e);
    rethrow;
  } finally {
    _registrationInProgress = null;
  }
}
```

### 4. Retry with Exponential Backoff

**Problem:** Network glitches or timing issues could cause registration failures
**Solution:** 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s)

```dart
const maxRetries = 3;
int attempt = 0;

while (attempt < maxRetries) {
  try {
    if (attempt > 1) {
      final delay = Duration(milliseconds: 500 * (1 << (attempt - 2)));
      await Future.delayed(delay);
    }

    await _sendCommand('builtin_player/register', ...);
    return; // Success
  } catch (e) {
    if (attempt >= maxRetries) rethrow;
    // Continue to next retry
  }
}
```

### 5. Registration Verification

**Problem:** Registration could succeed but player not appear in list
**Solution:** Verify player exists and is available after registration

```dart
// After registration
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));

final players = await getPlayers();
final registeredPlayer = players.where((p) => p.playerId == playerId).firstOrNull;

if (registeredPlayer == null) {
  _logger.log('⚠️ WARNING: Player registered but not found');
  // May retry if within retry limit
} else if (!registeredPlayer.available) {
  _logger.log('⚠️ WARNING: Player unavailable');
  throw Exception('Player unavailable - will retry');
}
```

---

## Registration Sequence (Exact Order)

Based on research findings, this is the EXACT sequence Ensemble follows:

### On Initial Connection

```
1. WebSocket connects
2. Receive server_info
3. [IF auth required] Authenticate with token/credentials
4. [IF auth required] Call fetchState() - loads providers
5. [IF auth required] Call auth/me - get display_name for player name
6. Check if fresh install → try ghost adoption
7. Get or create player ID (DeviceIdService)
8. Check if player already exists in MA
   → If exists and available: Resume state updates (skip registration)
   → If exists but unavailable: Re-register (revive stale player)
   → If doesn't exist: Normal registration
9. Call builtin_player/register
10. Call config/players/save (ensure complete persistence)
11. Verify player appears in player list
12. Start periodic state updates (1 second interval)
```

### On Reconnection

```
1. WebSocket reconnects
2. [IF auth required] Re-authenticate
3. [IF auth required] Call fetchState()
4. Get existing player ID from storage (NO new ID generation)
5. Check if player exists in MA
   → If exists and available: Resume (NO re-registration)
   → If exists but unavailable: Re-register
   → If missing: Register as new
6. Start state updates
```

**Key Difference:** Reconnection NEVER generates a new player ID. It always reuses the stored ID.

## Ghost Player Prevention

### What Creates Ghost Players

1. ❌ Generating new player ID on each connection
2. ❌ Re-registering when player already exists
3. ❌ Multiple simultaneous registration attempts
4. ❌ App crashes during registration (incomplete config)
5. ❌ Rapid app reinstalls without ghost adoption

### How Ensemble Prevents Ghosts

1. ✅ **Single persistent player ID** - Generated once, reused forever
2. ✅ **Smart reconnection** - Check before registering
3. ✅ **Registration guard** - Prevent concurrent attempts
4. ✅ **Ghost adoption** - Reuse existing player on reinstall
5. ✅ **Config persistence** - Explicit config/players/save call
6. ✅ **Verification** - Ensure player actually created

---

## Ghost Player Cleanup

### CRITICAL: API Deletion Does NOT Work

**Research Finding:** GitHub issues [#2494](https://github.com/music-assistant/hass-music-assistant/issues/2494), [#138937](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/138937) confirm that MA's player deletion APIs do NOT reliably persist.

**What the APIs do:**
- `builtin_player/unregister` - Removes from runtime only
- `players/remove` - Removes from player manager (runtime)
- `config/players/remove` - SHOULD remove from settings.json but doesn't always work

**Result:** Ghosts reappear after MA restart or reconnection.

### Manual Cleanup Method (ONLY RELIABLE WAY)

**Prerequisites:**
- SSH/terminal access to MA server
- Docker or direct filesystem access
- Backup of settings.json

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Backup first!
cp /home/home-server/docker/music-assistant/data/settings.json \
   /home/home-server/docker/music-assistant/data/settings.json.backup

# 2. Identify ghost players
cat /home/home-server/docker/music-assistant/data/settings.json | \
  jq '.players | to_entries[] | select(.value.provider == "builtin_player") | .key'

# Output example:
# "ensemble_4be5077a-2a21-42c3-9d06-2eaf48ae8ca7"  <- Kat's Phone (keep)
# "ensemble_6896c1f6-c735-4158-a0bb-74f12f81384e"  <- Ghost (remove)
# "ensemble_8556a5a6-7e4c-4b24-8c4e-5d3c9f8e2d1a"  <- Ghost (remove)

# 3. Remove specific ghost
cat settings.json | \
  jq 'del(.players["ensemble_6896c1f6-c735-4158-a0bb-74f12f81384e"])' > settings_fixed.json
mv settings_fixed.json settings.json

# 4. OR remove ALL unavailable players
cat settings.json | \
  jq '.players |= with_entries(select(.value.available == true or .value.available == null))' \
  > settings_fixed.json
mv settings_fixed.json settings.json

# 5. Restart MA
docker restart musicassistant

# 6. Verify
curl -s http://your-ma-server:8095/ -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"
# Should return 200
```

### Detecting Corrupt Configs

Corrupt players (missing required fields) can crash MA on startup.

**Check for corruption:**
```bash
cat settings.json | \
  jq '.players | to_entries[] | select(.value | has("provider") | not) | .key'
```

**Fix corruption:**
```bash
cat settings.json | \
  jq '.players |= with_entries(select(.value | has("provider")))' > settings_fixed.json
mv settings_fixed.json settings.json
docker restart musicassistant
```

### Ghost Adoption (Preventing New Ghosts on Reinstall)

When app is reinstalled, instead of creating a new ghost, Ensemble tries to "adopt" an existing one:

```dart
Future<bool> _tryAdoptGhostPlayer() async {
  // Only on fresh install
  final isFresh = await DeviceIdService.isFreshInstallation();
  if (!isFresh) return false;

  // Find ghost matching owner name
  final ownerName = await SettingsService.getOwnerName();
  final adoptableId = await _api!.findAdoptableGhostPlayer(ownerName);

  if (adoptableId != null) {
    // Adopt ghost's ID BEFORE generating new one
    await DeviceIdService.adoptPlayerId(adoptableId);
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

**Matching logic:**
- Looks for players named "{OwnerName}' Phone" or "{OwnerName}'s Phone"
- Prioritizes `ensemble_*` prefixed IDs
- Prefers unavailable players (true ghosts) but will adopt available ones too

---

## Multi-Client Support

### Current Design: One Player Per Device

Ensemble follows the official client pattern:
- **KMP App:** Single player per device (Android service ensures singleton)
- **Desktop Companion:** Single instance (Tauri prevents multiple processes)
- **Web Frontend:** Single session per browser

**Ensemble:** One player per app installation

### Multiple Devices Work Correctly

**Scenario:** Two phones, both running Ensemble

| Phone | Owner | Player ID | Player Name | Works? |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Phone A | Chris | ensemble_abc123 | Chris' Phone | ✅ Yes |
| Phone B | Kat | ensemble_def456 | Kat's Phone | ✅ Yes |

Each device gets its own unique player ID. They operate independently.

### Multiple Tabs on Same Device

**NOT RECOMMENDED:** Opening multiple Ensemble tabs creates multiple player instances.

**Why it's problematic:**
- Each tab could create a separate player
- No cross-tab coordination implemented
- Can lead to ghost accumulation

**Best Practice:** Use only one tab per device.

**Future Enhancement:** Could implement BroadcastChannel for cross-tab coordination (see research document for design).

---

## State Updates

### Heartbeat Pattern (From Research)

Ensemble sends state updates every 1 second (matches official clients):

```dart
Timer.periodic(Timings.localPlayerReportInterval, (_) async {
  await _reportLocalPlayerState();
});
```

**Why heartbeat matters:**
- MA uses timeout to clean up stale players
- No updates for ~10-15 minutes → player auto-removed
- Acts as "keepalive" signal

### State Update Contents

```dart
builtin_player/update_state {
  player_id: "ensemble_...",
  state: "playing" | "paused" | "idle",
  elapsed_time: 145,  // seconds
  current_item_id: "library://track/123",
  volume_level: 75
}
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Non-Auth MA Servers (Schema < 28)

Ensemble maintains compatibility with older MA servers:

```dart
// In MusicAssistantProvider
if (_api!.authRequired) {
  // New MA with auth
  await _api!.fetchState();
  await _fetchAndSetUserProfileName();
}

// Always works regardless of auth
await _tryAdoptGhostPlayer();
await _registerLocalPlayer();
```

### Auth Detection

```dart
// Server sends auth requirements
final needsAuth = data['needs_auth'] as bool? ?? false;
final authEnabled = data['auth_enabled'] as bool? ?? false;
final schemaVersion = data['schema_version'] as int?;

_authRequired = needsAuth || authEnabled || (schemaVersion != null && schemaVersion >= 28);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Single Device Tests

- [ ] Fresh install creates ONE player
- [ ] Player ID persists across app restarts
- [ ] Network disconnect/reconnect doesn't create ghost
- [ ] Killing app and reopening reuses same player ID
- [ ] Check MA settings.json - player has all required fields

### Multi-Device Tests

- [ ] Two phones connect simultaneously
- [ ] Each gets unique player ID
- [ ] Both can play independently
- [ ] One phone's actions don't affect the other
- [ ] Check settings.json - both players have complete configs

### CRITICAL: Two-Phone Playback Test (2025-12-05)

**Background:** Previous multi-client testing caused config corruption. When both phones
connected and played, one device's config became corrupted (missing `player_id` field),
causing error 999 on all subsequent playback attempts.

**Current State (cleaned 2025-12-05):**
| Device | Owner | Player ID | Config Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Chris' Phone | Chris | `ensemble_01aeaa82-71c2-4a69-943b-553c26c5ff67` | ✅ Complete |
| Kat's Phone | Kat | `ensemble_4be5077a-2a21-42c3-9d06-2eaf48ae8ca7` | ✅ Complete |

**Corrupted entries removed:** `ma_kdmgremuyu`, `ensemble_a9b2bdcd-8cd2-4fbf-9af2-35dd4c8f87b3`

**Test Steps:**
1. Chris' phone: Install latest APK, connect to MA
2. Kat's phone: Install latest APK, connect to MA
3. Verify both phones show their respective player selected
4. Chris' phone: Play a track to local player
5. Kat's phone: Verify NOT playing (cross-device isolation)
6. Kat's phone: Play a different track to local player
7. Both phones playing independently? ✅ or ❌

**After test, check for corruption:**
```bash
docker exec musicassistant cat /data/settings.json | jq '.players | to_entries[] | select(.key | startswith("ensemble_")) | {key: .key, has_player_id: (.value | has("player_id")), fields: (.value | keys | length)}'
```

**Expected:** Both players have `has_player_id: true` and `fields: 7`

**If error 999 occurs:**
1. Stop MA: `docker stop musicassistant`
2. Check which config is corrupted (run command above)
3. Fix or remove corrupted entry
4. Restart MA: `docker start musicassistant`
5. Document what action caused corruption

**Log markers to watch for:**
- ✅ Good: `✅ Verification passed: Player is available in MA`
- ⚠️ Warning: `⚠️ Player config is corrupted`
- ❌ Bad: `Command error: 999 - Field "player_id" of type str is missing`

### Reconnection Tests

- [ ] App reconnects after WiFi toggle
- [ ] App reconnects after MA server restart
- [ ] Player ID unchanged after reconnection
- [ ] No duplicate player created

### Ghost Tests

- [ ] Reinstall app → ghost adoption works
- [ ] Rapid app restart (10 times) → still only 1 player
- [ ] Force crash app → no ghost on restart
- [ ] Check settings.json - no incomplete entries

### Error Recovery Tests

- [ ] Registration fails → retries succeed
- [ ] Network fails mid-registration → recovers on next attempt
- [ ] MA returns error → logged clearly, retry works

## Known Limitations

### 1. API Deletion Unreliable

**Status:** Confirmed by research and GitHub issues
**Impact:** Ghost cleanup requires manual settings.json editing
**Mitigation:** Prevention focus, ghost adoption, clear documentation

### 2. No Multi-Tab Coordination

**Status:** Not implemented (official clients don't support it either)
**Impact:** Multiple tabs can create multiple players
**Mitigation:** User guidance to use single tab

### 3. Config Persistence Timing

**Status:** MA may batch writes, causing timing issues
**Impact:** Rapid operations could create incomplete configs
**Mitigation:** Delays and verification after registration

### 4. beforeunload Unreliability

**Status:** Browser limitation
**Impact:** Cleanup on tab close may not execute
**Mitigation:** MA's timeout mechanism cleans up stale players

---

## Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

Look for these log markers:

**Good signs:**
```
🆔 Using player ID: ensemble_xxx
✅ Player already registered and available
✅ Verification passed: Player is available in MA
```

**Warning signs:**
```
⚠️ Player exists but unavailable (stale), re-registering
⚠️ WARNING: Player registered but not found
🔄 Retry attempt 2/3
```

**Error signs:**
```
❌ CRITICAL: Player registration failed
❌ All 3 registration attempts failed
```

### Check MA Settings

**View player configs:**
```bash
cat /home/home-server/docker/music-assistant/data/settings.json | \
  jq '.players | to_entries[] | select(.value.provider == "builtin_player")'
```

**Valid entry:**
```json
{
  "key": "ensemble_4be5077a-2a21-42c3-9d06-2eaf48ae8ca7",
  "value": {
    "provider": "builtin_player",
    "player_id": "ensemble_4be5077a-2a21-42c3-9d06-2eaf48ae8ca7",
    "enabled": true,
    "available": true,
    "name": null,
    "default_name": "Chris' Phone",
    "values": {}
  }
}
```

**Invalid entry (corruption):**
```json
{
  "key": "ensemble_xxx",
  "value": {
    "default_name": "Chris' Phone"
    // Missing: provider, player_id, enabled, available
  }
}
```
